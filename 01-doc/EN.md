            |_ cachorro

#### archive
 - In the archive folder, you should place the training images in respective folders named after the classifications
 
#### archive_modify
- When the images are processed, they will go to the archive_modify folder

#### archive_out_trained
- Intended for images that you want to test which were not used in training

#### dataPickle
- In dataPickle, the file used to serialize the object with the content of the processed images will be saved

#### mask
- Due to the image processing techniques such as mirroring and rotation, this folder stores the mask image that will be applied over all processed images  

#### model
- In the model folder, the training file generated by TensorFlow (.h5) will be stored

#### properties
- Here, the .json file with the necessary configurations for the system to run smoothly is stored. You need to configure some parameters:

```
{
  "model_file_save": "C:\\dev\\workspaceMateus\\gaitule\\model\\mymodel.h5",
  "pickler_file": "C:\\dev\\workspaceMateus\\gaitule\\dataPickle\\data.pickle",
  "dir_pictures_modify": "C:\\dev\\workspaceMateus\\gaitule\\archive_modify",
  "dir_pictures": "C:\\dev\\workspaceMateus\\gaitule\\archive",
  "circle_mask": "C:\\dev\\workspaceMateus\\gaitule\\mask\\circleMask.png",
  "categories": ["inflamatorias", "normais"],
  "degress_rotation_interval": 20,
  "normalize_size_image": 512
}
```


Add the directory of your project accordingly or change it to the directory you prefer, respecting the functionality of each folder.

## Running

Creating a virtual environment:

```
python -m venv env
```

Activating the virtual environment:

```
cd /env/Scripts/activate
```

Inside the virtual environment:

To install the dependencies, run the command:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Running:
```
python src/run.py
```
